# simpleCPU
This is an experiment in simulating a very simple CPU, for my own education.
It is VERY loosely based on the classic 6502 Processor.
It will not run 6502 code, but hopefully I can get it to run something similar someday.

## Quickstart

- [Node.js@10.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install deps, ```npm i```
- Build ```npm run build```
- Start program, ```node dist/index.js```
- Run tests, ```npm t```
